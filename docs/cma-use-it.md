Connectivity Manager Agent
=====================================================================================

1. Compile and Install the Connectivity Manager Agent:

```bash
   sudo ./cm-agent.sh install  
```

This command checks that all the dependencies are installed on the host machine, for example git, python-pip, setuptools and installs all the required Python packages (using pip) in a virtual environment.
After doing that it compiles the source code and install the CM Agent to /opt/nubomedia/cm-agent.


2. Initialization of Agent config file: After installation you need to update the config file to reflect the correct OpenStack credentials

```bash
  sudo ./cm-agent.sh init
```

This command set the username and password for the usage of the Openstack environment. It is strongly required to set it. Or else it has to be edited manually in /etc/nubomedia/cm-agent.properties!

3. Make sure all Hosts within the tenant have opened the port 6640 for accessing the OVSDB via port and run the following command to allow it to be accessed remotely:

```bash
  sudo ovs-vsctl set-manager ptcp:6640
```

4. Make sure that controller for Openflow has been set for all compute and controller nodes running

```bash
    sudo ovs-vsctl set-controller br-int ptcp:6633
```
 
5. Manually start a screen session (it can't be started automatically because of the use of virtualenv's).

```bash
  screen -m -d -S cm-agent
```

6. Now within the screen session start the CM Agent using:

```bash
  sudo ./cm-agent.sh start
```

The API of the CM Agent is now served on Port 8091.
